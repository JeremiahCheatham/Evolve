# Evolve
Evolve entry for Space Jam: Evolution. https://itch.io/jam/space-jam1/rate/977215

Evolve from a Proto-Life to a Late Carnivore, Omnivore or Herbivore. Evolve is my first original game. You will need PyGame installed. To run it type python Evolve.py. Red is Carnivore and Blue is Herbivore. If you mix them you get an Omnivore. If you contact a predator you will loose health and be shielded for 3 seconds. You must eat to unlock the next evolution. The Food and Enemies for each species are different. Thank you.
